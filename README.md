A pure Haskell implementation of Reduced Orderded Binary Decision Diagrams.
---------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jwaldmann/haskell-obdd.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/jwaldmann/haskell-obdd)

This is mostly educational. The BDDs do not share nodes and this might introduce inefficiencies.

See https://github.com/jwaldmann/haskell-buddy for a Haskell API for BuDDy.
